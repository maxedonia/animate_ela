# animate_ela
Create a .gif of an image as it is increasingly compressed under Error Level Analysis (ELA). Cropping, formatting, compressing, photoshopping, facetuning, and/or similar manipulation techniques often leave artificats that become easier to identify when filtered with ELA. animate_ela converts a specified image into .jpg and then compresses it into 100 incremental steps of depreciating quality. Each instance, or step, is filtered using ELA and then automatically copied and converted into one of 100 frames for a short .gif that then animates the ELA reading frame-by-frame. 

Error Level Analysis is a simple forensic analysis filtering technique that can be useful when observed with a trained eye. ELA can distinguish particular spots within the input image where any warping, filtering, or photoshopping techniques are most likely to have been used. Many images of apocryphal origin can have multiple authorships and formatting conversions over time. Determining if a manipulation happened before or after another can be helpful when determining an image's authenticity and/or origina of ownership. Furthermore, the ability to see the ELA output of an image in a .gif format, wherein each sequential stage of compression is presented quickly and in rapid succession, can shed valuable insight by quickly illustrating at what fidelity errors become present, become most prevalent, or are not obserbvable relative to others found at different resolutions.
