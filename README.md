Error Level Analysis (ELA) helps identify areas in images that may have been altered, revealing distortions and/or manipulations. The ELA of an unedited image should maintain certain characteristics that are expected, regardless of the image's size/compression. By comparison, many popular, long-standing filters and warping effects leave behind traces of manipulation that become easier to notice by compressing the image. This makes ELA a particularly useful for examining images of dubious origin, or those which might have undergone various edits or format changes across multiple owners. With proper ELA, one can infer the image's authenticity, particular hotspots of digital manipulation, and even trace a possible history of modifications just by the discrepancies left behind at various stages of compression. Furthermore, a quick, frame-by-frame understanding of when and where manipulation may have been introduced can be easier to achieve if these various stages of compression are then consolidated and outputed in .gif format with animate_ela.
