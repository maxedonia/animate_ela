Error Level Analysis (ELA) detects alterations in images by highlighting discrepancies that occur between different degrees of compression in a digital format. Unedited images maintain consistent characteristics that accurately reflect a digital photo's composition, including but not limited to: contrast, lighting, sharpness, color & gradation. Digital distortion of a photograph leaves traces of artifacts, whether through the deliberate use of an editing application (Photoshop, Facetune, etc.) or via the AI filtering that is automatically applied as a default by a modern smart phone's operating system (such as iOS' night mode, portrait mode, etc.). This makes an error level analysis an effective forensic tool for identifying portions of a photo that have been edited, and if assessed properly, can even provide insight as to the chronology of edits if and when the image has been modified multiple times and/or by different authors over a period of time.

There is usually a chronology of authorship when it comes to images that have spread widely across the internet, often with each owner having their own obligatory digital fingerprint. In some cases, artifacts of ownership are observable with the right degree of compression when highlighting the discrepancies in what is basically the unexpected. But reducing an image down to it's limits is a wide bandwidth to consider, and means nothing without a modular way to compare any observations of a wide spectrum. I wanted to make sure that the simple concept was viable and consistent. But also was able to create raw instances the various stages of compression in a modular way to emulate the degredation of compression rapidly in an objective and/or forensic analysis.
