# animate_ela
Create a .gif of an image as it is increasingly compressed using error analysis. Cropping, formatting, compressing, photoshopping, facetuning, and/or similar manipulation techniques often leave artificats that become easier to identify when error level analysis (ELA) is performed on digital images. animate_ela converts a specified image into .jpg and then compresses it into 100 images in incremental steps of depreciating quality. Each instance is filtered using ELA and then automatically copied and converted into frames for a short .gif that animates the ELA reading over 100 frames. Error Level Analysis can provide valuable insight that a trained eye, as well as where within the input image any warping, filtering, or photoshopping techniques are most likely to have been used. Furthermore, the ability to see the ELA outputs in a .gif format is  helpful in a forensic analysis wherein the many different stages of compression shown quickly and sequentially can shed insight into the chronology of manipulations as they were made relative to other ones, if and when the image has been changed repeatedly, or when the image is at least a few generations or has changed authorship multiple times over the course of its use.
