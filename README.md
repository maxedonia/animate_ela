# animate_ela
Create a .gif of an image as it is increasingly compressed using error analysis. Cropping, formatting, compressing, photoshopping, facetuning, and/or similar manipulation techniques often leave artificats that become easier to identify when error level analysis (ELA) is performed on digital images. animate_ela converts a specified image into .jpg and then compresses it into 100 images in incremental steps of depreciating quality. Each instance is filtered using ELA and then automatically copied and converted into frames for a short .gif that animates the ELA reading over 100 frames. ELA can give valuable insight into what kind of manipulation has been used, as well as where in a photo they are liekly being used. Furthermore, the ability to see the ELA outputs in a .gif format can give a trained eye important forensic information, and in some cases, strong clues as to the chronological order of any changes made to the image over time,if and when properly used.
