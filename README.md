# **ELA ALLY**

## **Error Level Analysis**
Digitally editing photos, whether through AI filtering, Photoshop, Facetune, etc., can quickly diminish the original composition's contrast, lighting, sharpness, color & gradation. By comparison, unedited images maintain these characteristics, and thereby reflect the accuracy of a digital photo's composition. This is still true when an unaltered image is compressed to a fraction of it's original fidelity. Error Level Analysis (ELA) is a tool that can be used in forensic analysis of a digital image by identifying portions of a photo that do not accurately reflect the expected output of the composition when compressed. A more thorough explanation of ELA can be [found here](https://fotoforensics.com/tutorial-ela.php).



The artifacts left behind in an image that has signs of warping, facetuning, filtering, cloning, etc. are difficult to separate from the image or any future versions of it. What remains present won't disappear if the image is resized or converted to a different format, either. Any additional manipulation will only compound the evidence that is already embedded from previous edits and ultimately reduce the image's overall quality & fidelity, as well as further obfuscate its origin or authorship.

ELA Ally works by compressing and filtering the image at incremental stages of decreased resolution. These results are then compiled into an animated GIF. The options for output also includes the speed at which the frames are composited, the ability to blend output with the original reference image, and tuning the scale of ELA present in resulting output.
