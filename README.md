Error Level Analysis (ELA) helps identify areas in images that may have been altered, uaing the discrepancies present between various fidelities of the same image that reveal distortion and/or manipulation. The ELA of an unedited image should maintain certain characteristics that are to be expected, and regardless of the image's size, format, or degree of compression. By comparison, many popular image filters and warping effects leave behind traces of their use, making manipulations easy to observe by compressing the image and using ELA to show where deviations from the expected output take place. This makes ELA a particularly useful for examining images of dubious origin, or those which might have undergone various edits or format changes across multiple owners. With proper analysis, one can infer the image's authenticity, particular hotspots of digital distortion, and even infer the possible chronology of modifications just by the discrepancies left behind at various stages of compression. In some cases, a frame-by-frame understanding of when and where manipulation may have been introduced can be quickly and more easily assessed if these various stages of compression are then consolidated and outputed in .gif format using animate_ela.
