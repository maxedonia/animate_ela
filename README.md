Error Level Analysis (ELA) helps identify areas in images that may have been altered, using the discrepancies present at various stages of compression of the same image to reveal distortion and/or manipulation. The ELA of an unedited image should maintain certain characteristics that are to be expected, and even under extreme compression. By comparison, many popular image filters and warping effects leave behind traces of their use, making manipulations easy to observe by using ELA on compressed instances of the image to show where deviations from the expected output occur. This makes ELA a particularly useful forensic tool for examining images of dubious origin, or those which might have undergone various edits and/or format changes. With the proper analysis, one can infer the image's authenticity, particular hotspots of digital distortion, and even infer the possible chronology of modifications just by referencing the discrepancies left behind at various stages of compression in context. In some cases, a frame-by-frame understanding of when and where manipulation may occur can be quickly and more easily assessed if the various stages of compression are consolidated under ELA and outputed in .gif format using animate_ela.
