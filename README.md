Error Level Analysis (ELA) detects alterations in images by highlighting discrepancies that occur between different degrees of compression in a digital format. Unedited images maintain consistent characteristics that accurately reflect a digital photo's composition, including but not limited to: contrast, lighting, sharpness, color & gradation. Digital distortion of a photograph leaves traces of artifacts, whether through the deliberate use of an editing application (Photoshop, Facetune, etc.) or via the AI filtering that is automatically applied as a default by a modern smart phone's operating system (such as iOS' night mode, portrait mode, etc.). This makes an error level analysis an effective forensic tool for identifying portions of a photo that have been edited, and if assessed properly, can even provide insight as to the chronology of edits if and when the image has been modified multiple times and/or by different authors over a period of time. For more insight, the animate_ela script compiles the various increments of a compressed image under ELA and then converts the results into frames that are exported in an animated .gif format. This format allows for additional context that would otherwise prove slower or more difficult to assess when using only one or two instances of ELA alone.
