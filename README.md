Error Level Analysis (ELA) detects alterations in images by highlighting discrepancies across different compression levels. Unedited images maintain consistent characteristics under compression, whereas edited images show traces of manipulation not immediately visible. ELA reveals these deviations, especially in compressed formats, making it an effective forensic tool for analyzing images with questionable origins or multiple edits. It allows for the assessment of an image's authenticity and the identification of manipulation hotspots, potentially tracing the sequence of edits. For clearer analysis, the animate_ela script can compile these compression stages into a sequential .gif, offering a visual representation of the ELA findings that can then be interpretted.
